        <h2>What kind of information can the user control and change?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Linking contacts</li>
          <li>Assignments (speaking / listening)</li>
          <li>Courses / language</li>
          <li>Notifications</li>
          <li>Daily goals (minutes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the Duolingo app and website, the user can change whether they want to link contacts, change the language
          course, change whether they want speaking assignments or not and change the notifications. It makes it so that
          the user has the best experience in learning a new language. It makes it so that the notifications and
          assignments can be adjusted to the daily or weekly routine of the user.
        </p>
        <br>
        </br>
        <h2>How does the application lead the user activity?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear interface</li>
          <li>Some things cannot be found (as easy) in the app</li>
          <li>Clear icons</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The interface of Duolingo is very clear. The only time I have had to search something for help was to remove a
          language course I accidentally added. This apparently could not be found in the app, but on the website. This
          was not very convenient as I don’t always have my laptop with me, or on. </p>
        <br>
        </br>
        <h2>Can the user make changes to the interface?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Dark/Light mode</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The only option to change the interface is to turn on/off dark mode. The courses are the same for everybody
          that does the same level of the language.
        </p>
        <br>
        </br>
        <h2>Is the interface "inductive" or "deductive"?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear profile creation</li>
          <li>Clear questions (level of language etc.)</li>
          <li>Not too many options</li>
          <li>Clear instructions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The app is clear with the process of creating the profile.
          The questions are clear.
          Such as: What language would you like to learn?
          Then it shows the flags of each country and the name of the language. It also asks: Do you already know a bit
          of the chosen language? The app then shows a few buttons with texts like “No” or “A little bit” on which you
          can click. In the app it is very clear what steps to take to partake in a course. When on the main page there
          are not many different options, but only to click on which level you want to partake in next, as well as icons
          that have a clear meaning. Buttons are clear and so is the text. During the learning process when you click on
          the level you want to learn in on the app, there are very clear instructions on how to do the exercises, such
          as: “Touch to speak” for speaking assignments or “Put the buttons in the right order” or “Touch the buttons
          with the words that are being said in the right order”.</p>
        <br>
        </br>
        <h2>Does the application offer a "progressive disclosure" in relation to its workflow?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Weekly emails</li>
          <li>Statistics</li>
          <li>New words</li>
          <li>New sentences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the app, your progress is shown by either having more chapters available to you or by a yellow line around
          the chapter. Each chapter must be done 5 times (though more is possible to practice or earn prizes) for you to
          open the next chapter and make progress.</p>
        <br>
        </br>
        <h2>Does the application involve an Authorization process? What are the steps involved in the Login/Logout?</h2>
        <p>The flow of both of the apps is great, it’s mad extremely clear what option the user has and what steps to
          take
          in the process of creating the account and learning within the app or website. You need to sign up using your
          mail and choose if you want the premium paid version or not. I remember having to confirm my email.</p>

        <h2>What kind of information can the user control and change?</h2>
        <p>
          In the app and website, the user can change whether they want to link or share their profile on social
          media
          or share with friends through whatsapp. They can also change the language course and change the
          notifications.

        <h2>How does the application lead the user activity?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Links to webpage for help</li>
          <li>Shows billing and premium subscription first</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Busuu help page links to a webpage instead of being in the app, which is less convenient. The page
          also has buttons that show up, of which the first ones are about the premium description and billing and
          business, which are usually not the first things I look for when I have just downloaded an app.</p>
        <h2>Can the user make changes to the interface?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Dark/Light mode</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The only option to change the interface is to turn on/off dark mode. The courses are the same for
          everybody
          that does the same level of the language. However, compared to Duolingo the interface is not as
          satisfying
          to look at or nearly as attractive.
          You need to sign up using your mail and choose if you want the premium paid version or not. I also had
          received an email, but not one to confirm my identity.
        </p>
        <br>
        </br>
        <h2>Is the interface "inductive" or "deductive"?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inductive</li>
          <li>Not as clear compared to Duolingo</li>
          <li>Webpage is more deductive</li>
          <li>Too much for the app's interface</li>
          <li>Unclear icons</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The interface of Busuu is a bit more distracting because of the ads for the premium version being at the
          top of the screen.
          There are a lot of different looking buttons to click compared to the Duolingo app. The icon to learn your
          language is the earth / globe icon, which also confused me. The term “Learn” remind me more of books or
          glasses. However, because it was the icon on the lower left, I knew that was the one to click to continue
          learning. I would not say it is deductive. Some things are not as logical as in the Duolingo app. The
          webpage for Busuu I would say is deductive. There is simply too much information and too many buttons to
          click for the interface of the app.
        </p>
        <br>
        </br>
        <h2>Does the application offer a "progressive disclosure" in relation to its workflow?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Statistics</li>
          <li>New words</li>
          <li>Weak words</li>
          <li>Medium words</li>
          <li>Strong words</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Like Duolingo, the app shows you when you’ve made progress and how fluent you are in the language within
          the app. It is clear when it comes to showing the rates / tables. However, I do think there are way too
          many buttons to click on and unnecessary ads.</p>
        <br>
        </br>
        <h2>Does the application involve an Authorization process?
          What are the steps involved in the Login/Logout?</h2>
        <p>You need to sign up using your mail and choose if you want the premium paid version or not. I also had
          received an email, but not one to confirm my identity. To log out there are only a few buttons to push,
          however it is not an app where you’d easily want to log out as it has your personalized profile and course(s).
          To log out, like with many apps, you simply must click on your profile picture which in the Busuu app is on
          the lower right, then go to the settings button, scroll down and click “log out”.
